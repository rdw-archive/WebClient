The Revival WebClient is browser-based client capable of rendering networked multiplayer games using modern web technologies

## Status

Work is currently in process to build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) prototype. It's not ready for actual use, but rather something I'm continually tinkering with and that's developed alongside other, as of yet undisclosed projects.

Feel free to ask questions, make suggestions, or give feedback via creating issues, but please don't expect this to "just work" or have many features. It likely will be released properly some day, but today is not that day.

The only reason I opened up the repository already is because it's required for certain things (GitHub pages, CI actions, etc.). Consider this a private repository that may or may not end up in a publicly-releasable state in the future. Or maybe it won't, you never know with these side projects.

Also, assume the git history can change (`rebase`) as I don't expect anyone to actually clone this repository yet. Nothing is set in stone, as far as I'm concerned.
